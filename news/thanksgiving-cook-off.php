				<p>What a fabulous event we all witnessed on the day before thanksgiving. Several volunteers got together at Jim McIntire home to cook 4 complete turkey dinners for families of the Evergreen Senior Apartment Complex. We are so touched by the response of several Senior citizens that received the much needed food that Guzman23Foundation will be doing many more events with Evergreen. Here are some of the pictures from the event.</p>
