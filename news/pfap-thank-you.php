				<!-- TEXT -->
				<p>Thank you so much for your generous support and participation in the First Annual Guzman23Foundation Golf Tournament. It was a tremendous success and with your donations we will be able to help many families that suffer from Alzheimer&rsquo;s in our community. We look forward to our next event and hope that you will continue to support our cause.</p>
				<p>As you know, many families and individuals in our community suffer when Alzheimer&rsquo;s affects a family member. Just as in my case with my Mother my family had to adapt to care for her. This can stricken the family with hardships like money, or the need for bare essentials to continue care.</p>
				<p>With the generous support of people like you, we will be able to help many of these families and individuals not only to meet essential daily needs, but to work toward a brighter future with programs to better understand how to cope with this terrible disease.</p>
